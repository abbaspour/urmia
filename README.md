Urmia.io Compute Engine
=======================

this is mostly an independent open-source clone of excellent [Joyent Manta](https://www.joyent.com/products/object-storage)
 compute platform and supports docker images for processing. 

see [Manta](https://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/) on how to interact with it.

Urmia.io is developed in Java but does all disk/net operations in kernel landscape and NIO thanks to [Netty](http://netty.io).
